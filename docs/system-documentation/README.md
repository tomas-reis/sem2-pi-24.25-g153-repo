# System Documentation

In this folder, the team should collect and keep up-to-date all artifacts associated with the activities of the Software Development Process, including Requirements Engineering, OO Analysis and OO Design, related to the Integrative Project.

The artifacts should be developed in accordance with the [template files](../(template-files)).

**It is highly recommended to organize the content of each User Story into a dedicated subfolder (for example, content related to US10 should be located in a folder named US10).**
