# Platform for Outsourcing Tasks Example

This folder contains sample documentation for the Platform for Outsourcing Tasks project.

**Excerpt from the Project Specification Document**

_A startup needs to develop a software product that, on the one hand, allows the registration of any interested organization, to be able to publish tasks and manage the process of assigning these tasks to freelancers; and, on the other hand, allow freelancers to easily access these tasks and apply for them._

(...)

_This product is expected to be accessed by several users with different roles, such as:_
* _Organization Employee: someone acting on behalf of a particular organization; employees are responsible for specifying and cataloging tasks for later publication by the organization._

* _Freelancers: people who propose to carry out  tasks published by organizations._
